"""
An ObjectType is the single, definitive source of information about your data.
It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data youâ€™re querying.

The basics:

Each ObjectType is a Python class that inherits from graphene.ObjectType.

Each attribute of the ObjectType represents a Field.
